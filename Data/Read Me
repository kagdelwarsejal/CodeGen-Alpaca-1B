# Data Folder

This folder contains the datasets used for fine-tuning **CodeGen-Alpaca-1B**.  

## Datasets

### 1. CodeAlpaca 2k Subset
- **File:** `codealpaca_2k.json` (or whichever your file is named)  
- **Size:** 2,000 instruction → code pairs  
- **Purpose:** Used for **quick/faster fine-tuning experiments** on lightweight GPUs (e.g., Colab T4)  
- **Notes:** Ideal for testing and small-scale experiments.  

### 2. CodeAlpaca 20k Full Dataset
- **File:** `codealpaca_20k.json`  
- **Size:** 20,000 instruction → code pairs  
- **Purpose:** Used for **full-scale fine-tuning** for better model performance  
- **Notes:** Requires more GPU memory and longer training time  

## License
- Both datasets are **MIT licensed**.  
- You are free to use and modify them for research or fine-tuning purposes.
